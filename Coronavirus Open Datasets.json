The Associated Press is sharing this data as the most comprehensive current national source of COVID-19 outbreaks in state and federal prisons. Lawyers, criminal justice reform advocates and families of the incarcerated have worried about what was happening in prisons across the nation as coronavirus began to take hold in the communities outside. Data collected by The Marshall Project shows that thousands of prisoners have caught the illness as prisons became the center of some of the country’s largest outbreaks. Thousands more workers, correctional officers and medical staff have been sickened. And hundreds of people — most of them incarcerated — have died. This data, which will be updated weekly, is an effort to track how those people have been affected and where the crisis has hit the hardest. ## Methodology and Caveats The data tracks the number of COVID-19 tests administered to people incarcerated in all state and federal prisons, as well as the staff in those facilities. It has been collected on a weekly basis by Marshall Project reporters who contacted each prison agency directly and verified published figures with officials. Each week, the reporters ask every prison agency for the total number of coronavirus tests administered to its staff members and prisoners, the cumulative number who tested positive among staff and prisoners, and the numbers of deaths for each group. The time series data is aggregated to the system level; there is one record for each prison agency on each date of collection. Not all departments could provide data for the exact date requested, and the data indicates the date for the figures. To estimate the rate of infection among prisoners, we also collected population data for each prison system. In cases where current data was unavailable, we used the most recent available population numbers from the agencies in 10 states: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Indiana, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, Nevada, Ohio. To estimate the rate of infection among prison employees, we collected staffing numbers for each system. Where current data was not publicly available, we acquired other numbers through our reporting, including calling agencies or from state budget documents. In six states, we were unable to find recent staffing figures: Alaska, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Montana, Utah. In July, we published a story based on a new round of data collection of prison population figures for March and June. You can read more extensively about our methodology in [our Github repository for the story](https://github.com/themarshallproject/COVID_prison_population_data) and by examining the `explanation` column of the `updated_prison_populations.csv` file. As with all COVID-19 data, our understanding of the spread and impact of the virus is limited by the availability of testing. Epidemiology and public health experts say that aside from a few states that have recently begun aggressively testing in prisons, it is likely that there are more cases of COVID-19 circulating undetected in facilities. Sixteen prison systems, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, would not release information about how many prisoners they are testing. The Marshall Project plans to update this dataset on a weekly basis. ## About the Data There are four tables in this data: * `covid_prison_cases.csv` contains weekly time series data on tests, infections and deaths in prisons. The first dates in the table are on March 26. Any questions that a prison agency could not or would not answer are left blank. * `prison_populations.csv` contains a one-time, recent snapshot of the population of people incarcerated in each of these prison systems, collected as close to April 15 as possible. * `staff_populations.csv` contains a one-time, recent snapshot of the headcount of workers for each prison agency, collected as close to April 15 as possible. * `updated_prison_populations.csv` contains an updated comparison of state and federal prison populations and the change between March and June of 2020, during the initial wave of the coronavirus pandemic. (In states with unified jail and prison systems—Connecticut, Vermont, Delaware, Hawaii and Rhode Island—pre-trial detainees are not included in population counts.) ## Queries The Associated Press and The Marshall Project have created several queries to help you use this data: > Get your state's prison COVID data: Provides each week's data from just your state and calculates a cases-per-100000-prisoners rate, a deaths-per-100000-prisoners rate, a cases-per-100000-workers rate and a deaths-per-100000-workers rate **[here](https://data.world/associatedpress/marshall-project-covid-cases-in-prisons/workspace/query?queryid=024f73fd-758e-430f-98ce-73e6f0d01cae&showTemplatePreview=true)** > Rank all systems' most recent data by cases per 100,000 prisoners **[here](https://data.world/associatedpress/marshall-project-covid-cases-in-prisons/workspace/query?queryid=1c148e14-1055-4388-b41a-2f9207abaa3d)** > Find what percentage of your state's total cases and deaths -- as reported by [Johns Hopkins University](https://data.world/associatedpress/johns-hopkins-coronavirus-case-tracker) -- occurred within the prison system **[here](https://data.world/associatedpress/marshall-project-covid-cases-in-prisons/workspace/query?queryid=106ff3b8-c5d7-4ead-8844-fddb1479c379)** ## Attribution In stories attribute this data to: “According to an analysis of state prison cases by The Marshall Project, a nonprofit investigative newsroom dedicated to the U.S. criminal justice system, and The Associated Press.” ## Contributors Many reporters and editors at The Marshall Project and The Associated Press contributed to this data, including: Katie Park, Tom Meagher, Weihua Li, Gabe Isman, Cary Aspinwall, Keri Blakinger, Jake Bleiberg, Andrew R.

The COVID Tracking Project data is available at the state level in the United States. The AP has paired this data with population figures and has calculated testing rates and death rates per 1,000 people. This data is from [The COVID Tracking Project API](https://covidtracking.com/api) that is updated regularly throughout the day. Like all organizations dealing with data, The COVID Tracking Project is constantly refining and cleaning up their feed, so there may be brief moments where data does not appear correctly. At [this link](https://covidtracking.com/data), you’ll find The COVID Tracking Project daily data reports, and a clean version of their feed. **A Note on timing**: - The COVID Tracking Project updates regularly throughout the day, but state numbers will come in at different times. The entire Tracking Project dataset will be updated between 4-5pm EDT daily. Keep this time in mind when reporting on stories comparing states. At certain times of day, one state may be more up to date than another. We have included the `date_modified` timestamp for state-level data, which represents the last time the state updated its data. The `date_checked` value in the state-level data reflects the last time The COVID Tracking Project checked the state source. We have also included the `last_modified` timestamp for the national-level data, which marks the last time the national data was updated. The AP is updating this dataset hourly at 45 minutes past the hour.

They are the total number of tests that have returned `positive` or `negative`. - The process for collecting testing data is different for each state. The COVID Tracking Project makes note of the difficulties specific to each state on their [main data page](https://covidtracking.com/data). ## Attribution This data should be credited to The COVID Tracking Project ## Contact Nicky Forster — nforster@ap.org "}},{"v_0":{"type":"literal","value":"associatedpress"},"v_1":{"type":"literal","value":"johns-hopkins-coronavirus-case-tracker"},"v_2":{"type":"literal","value":"Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Case Tracker"},"v_3":{"type":"literal","value":"Johns Hopkins' county-level COVID-19 case and death data, paired with population and rates per 100,000"},"v_4":{"type":"literal","value":"--- {\"editor\":\"markdown\"} --- #### Updates - April 9, 2020 - The population estimate data for New York County, NY has been updated to include all five New York City counties (Kings County, Queens County, Bronx County, Richmond County and New York County). This has been done to match the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 data, which aggregates counts for the five New York City counties to New York County. - April 20, 2020 - Johns Hopkins death totals in the US now include confirmed and probable deaths in accordance with CDC guidelines as of April 14. One significant result of this change was an increase of more than 3,700 deaths in the New York City count. This change will likely result in increases for death counts elsewhere as well. The AP does not alter the Johns Hopkins source data, so probable deaths are included in this dataset as well. - April 29, 2020 - The AP is now providing timeseries data for counts of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The raw counts are provided here unaltered, along with a population column with Census ACS-5 estimates and calculated daily case and death rates per 100,000 people. Please read the updated caveats section for more information. --- ## Overview The AP is using data collected by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering as our source for outbreak caseloads and death counts for the United States and globally. The Hopkins data is available at the county level in the United States. The AP has paired this data with population figures and county rural/urban designations, and has calculated caseload and death rates per 100,000 people. Be aware that caseloads may reflect the availability of tests -- and the ability to turn around test results quickly -- rather than actual disease spread or true infection rates. This data is from the [Hopkins dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) that is updated regularly throughout the day. Like all organizations dealing with data, Hopkins is constantly refining and cleaning up their feed, so there may be brief moments where data does not appear correctly.

Be aware that because this ranks per-capita caseloads, very small counties may rise to the very top, so take into account raw caseload figures as well. ## Interactive The AP has designed an interactive map to track COVID-19 cases reported by Johns Hopkins. @(https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nRyaf/15/) #### Interactive Embed Code <iframe title=\"USA counties (2018) choropleth map Mapping COVID-19 cases by county\" aria-describedby=\"\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-nRyaf\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nRyaf/10/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width: 0; min-width: 100% !important;\" height=\"400\"></iframe><script type=\"text/javascript\">(function() {'use strict';window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {if (typeof event.data['datawrapper-height'] !== 'undefined') {for (var chartId in event.data['datawrapper-height']) {var iframe = document.getElementById('datawrapper-chart-' + chartId) || document.querySelector(\"iframe[src*='\" + chartId + \"']\");if (!iframe) {continue;}iframe.style.height = event.data['datawrapper-height'][chartId] + 'px';}}});})();</script> ## Caveats * This data represents the number of cases and deaths reported by each state and has been collected by Johns Hopkins from a number of sources cited on their website. * In some cases, deaths or cases of people who've crossed state lines -- either to receive treatment or because they became sick and couldn't return home while traveling -- are reported in a state they aren't currently in, because of state reporting rules. * In some states, there are a number of cases not assigned to a specific county -- for those cases, the county name is \"unassigned to a single county\" * This data should be credited to Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 tracking project. The AP is simply making it available here for ease of use for reporters and members. * Caseloads may reflect the availability of tests -- and the ability to turn around test results quickly -- rather than actual disease spread or true infection rates. * Population estimates at the county level are drawn from 2014-18 5-year estimates from the American Community Survey. * The Urban/Rural classification scheme is from the Center for Disease Control and Preventions's National Center for Health Statistics. It puts each county into one of six categories -- from Large Central Metro to Non-Core -- according to population and other characteristics. More details about the classifications can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/urban_rural.htm). **Johns Hopkins timeseries data** - Johns Hopkins pulls data regularly to update their dashboard. Once a day, around 8pm EDT, Johns Hopkins adds the counts for all areas they cover to the timeseries file. These counts are snapshots of the latest cumulative counts provided by the source on that day. This can lead to inconsistencies if a source updates their historical data for accuracy, either increasing or decreasing the latest cumulative count. - Johns Hopkins periodically edits their historical timeseries data for accuracy. They provide a file documenting all errors in their timeseries files that they have identified and fixed [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/Errata.csv) ## Attribution This data should be credited to Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 tracking project "}},{"v_0":{"type":"literal","value":"associatedpress"},"v_1":{"type":"literal","value":"covid-impact-survey-public-data"},"v_2":{"type":"literal","value":"COVID Impact Survey - Public Data"},"v_3":{"type":"literal","value":"Shares data from the COVID Impact Survey, a regular statistical look at health, economic and social issues"},"v_4":{"type":"literal","value":"--- {\"editor\":\"markdown\"} --- ## Overview The Associated Press is sharing data from the [COVID Impact Survey](https://www.covid-impact.org/), which provides statistics about physical health, mental health, economic security and social dynamics related to the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. Conducted by [NORC at the University of Chicago](https://www.norc.org/Pages/default.aspx) for the [Data Foundation](https://www.datafoundation.org/), the probability-based survey provides estimates for the United States as a whole, as well as in 10 states (California, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New York, Oregon and Texas) and eight metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Baltimore, Birmingham, Chicago, Cleveland, Columbus, Phoenix and Pittsburgh). The survey is designed to allow for an ongoing gauge of public perception, health and economic status to see what is shifting during the pandemic. When multiple sets of data are available, it will allow for the tracking of how issues ranging from COVID-19 symptoms to economic status change over time. The survey is focused on three core areas of research: * Physical Health: Symptoms related to COVID-19, relevant existing conditions and health insurance coverage. * Economic and Financial Health: Employment, food security, and government cash assistance. * Social and Mental Health: Communication with friends and family, anxiety and volunteerism. (Questions based on those used on the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey.) ## Using this Data - IMPORTANT This is survey data and must be **_properly weighted_** during analysis: **DO NOT REPORT THIS DATA AS RAW OR AGGREGATE NUMBERS!!** Instead, use our queries linked below or statistical software such as R or SPSS to weight the data. ## Queries If you'd like to create a table to see how people nationally or in your state or city feel about a topic in the survey, use the survey questionnaire and codebook to match a question (the variable label) to a variable name. For instance, \"How often have you felt lonely in the past 7 days?\" is variable \"soc5c\". > Nationally: Go to **[this](https://data.world/associatedpress/covid-impact-survey-public-data/workspace/query?queryid=cbafc64a-8041-4dcc-9c6d-d0b5e9acdf90&showTemplatePreview=true)** query and enter soc5c as the variable. Hit the blue Run Query button in the upper right hand corner. > Local or State: To find figures for that response in a specific state, go to **[this](https://data.world/associatedpress/covid-impact-survey-public-data/workspace/query?queryid=789ee870-b024-4d07-84bd-95f2e41da342&showTemplatePreview=true)** query and type in a state name and soc5c as the variable, and then hit the blue Run Query button in the upper right hand corner. The resulting sentence you could write out of these queries is: _\"People in some states are less likely to report loneliness than others. For example, 66% of Louisianans report feeling lonely on none of the last seven days, compared with 52% of Californians. Nationally, 60% of people said they hadn't felt lonely.\"_ ## Margin of Error The margin of error for the national and regional surveys is found in the attached methods statement. You will need the margin of error to determine if the comparisons are statistically significant. If the difference is: * At least twice the margin of error, you can report there is a clear difference. * At least as large as the margin of error, you can report there is a slight or apparent difference. * Less than or equal to the margin of error, you can report that the respondents are divided or there is no difference. ## A Note on Timing Survey results will generally be posted under embargo on Tuesday evenings. The data is available for release at 1 p.m. ET Thursdays. ## About the Data The survey data will be provided under embargo in both comma-delimited and statistical formats. Each set of survey data will be numbered and have the date the embargo lifts in front of it in the format of: _01\\_April\\_30\\_covid\\_impact\\_survey_. The survey has been organized by the [Data Foundation](https://www.datafoundation.org/), a non-profit non-partisan think tank, and is sponsored by the [Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/) and the [Packard Foundation](https://www.packard.org/). It is conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago, a non-partisan research organization. (NORC is not an abbreviation, it part of the organization's formal name.) Data for the national estimates are collected using the AmeriSpeak Panel, NORC’s probability-based panel designed to be representative of the U.S. household population. Interviews are conducted with adults age 18 and over representing the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Panel members are randomly drawn from AmeriSpeak with a target of achieving 2,000 interviews in each survey. Invited panel members may complete the survey online or by telephone with an NORC telephone interviewer. Once all the study data have been made final, an iterative raking process is used to adjust for any survey nonresponse as well as any noncoverage or under and oversampling resulting from the study specific sample design. Raking variables include age, gender, census division, race/ethnicity, education, and county groupings based on county level counts of the number of COVID-19 deaths. Demographic weighting variables were obtained from the 2020 Current Population Survey. The count of COVID-19 deaths by county was obtained from USA Facts. The weighted data reflect the U.S. population of adults age 18 and over. Data for the regional estimates are collected using a multi-mode address-based (ABS) approach that allows residents of each area to complete the interview via web or with an NORC telephone interviewer. All sampled households are mailed a postcard inviting them to complete the survey either online using a unique PIN or via telephone by calling a toll-free number. Interviews are conducted with adults age 18 and over with a target of achieving 400 interviews in each region in each survey.Additional details on the [survey methodology](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e8769b34812765cff8111f7/t/5ea495a78315084d6dc83cd0/1587844524658/Updated_COVID+Impact_Methods_Statement.pdf) and the [survey questionnaire](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e8769b34812765cff8111f7/t/5e99d902ca4a0277b8b5fb51/1587140880354/COVID-19+Tracking+Survey+Questionnaire+041720.pdf) are attached below or can be found at [https://www.covid-impact.org](https://www.covid-impact.org/). ## Attribution Results should be credited to the [COVID Impact Survey](https://www.covid-impact.org/), conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for the Data Foundation. ## AP Data Distributions ​To learn more about AP's data journalism capabilities for publishers, corporations and financial institutions, go here or email kromano@ap.org."}},{"v_0":{"type":"literal","value":"sagarg"},"v_1":{"type":"literal","value":"covid19"},"v_2":{"type":"literal","value":"COVID19"},"v_3":{"type":"literal","value":"Insights on Covid 19"},"v_7":{"type":"literal","datatype":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean","value":"true"}},{"v_0":{"type":"literal","value":"pablosambuco"},"v_1":{"type":"literal","value":"covid19"},"v_2":{"type":"literal","value":"COVID19"}},{"v_0":{"type":"literal","value":"hdx"},"v_1":{"type":"literal","value":"0f423f66-0409-4ad6-965b-2fed88b71b3d"},"v_2":{"type":"literal","value":"Haiti: Coronavirus (COVID-19) Subnational Cases"},"v_3":{"type":"literal","value":"Haiti: Coronavirus (COVID-19) Subnational Cases"},"v_4":{"type":"literal","value":"This dataset contains the number of suspected cases, confirmed cases, and deaths by Département due to the Coronavirus pandemic in Haiti.

We are compiling this time series data from state and local governments and health departments in an attempt to provide a complete record of the ongoing outbreak. Since late January, The Times has tracked cases of coronavirus in real time as they were identified after testing. Because of the widespread shortage of testing, however, the data is necessarily limited in the picture it presents of the outbreak. We have used this data to power our [maps](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html) and [reporting](https://www.nytimes.com/coronavirus) tracking the outbreak, and it is now being made available to the public in response to requests from researchers, scientists and government officials who would like access to the data to better understand the outbreak. The data begins with the first reported coronavirus case in Washington State on Jan. 21, 2020. We will publish regular updates to the data in this repository. # United States Data Data on cumulative coronavirus cases and deaths can be found in two files for states and counties. Each row of data reports cumulative counts based on our best reporting up to the moment we publish an update. We do our best to revise earlier entries in the data when we receive new information. Both files contain [FIPS codes](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/note/US/fips), a standard geographic identifier, to make it easier for an analyst to combine this data with other data sets like a map file or population data. ## State-Level Data State-level data can be found in the us-states.csv file. date,state,fips,cases,deaths 2020-01-21,Washington,53,1,0 ... ## County-Level Data County-level data can be found in the us-counties.csv file. date,county,state,fips,cases,deaths 2020-01-21,Snohomish,Washington,53061,1,0 ... In some cases, the geographies where cases are reported do not map to standard county boundaries.

Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected. Estimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction. More detail about the methods, weighting, data, and limitations can be found in the Technical Notes.

On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the Nationally Notifiable Condition List and classified as “immediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)” by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (Interim-20-ID-01). The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data are collected and reported voluntarily to CDC’s COVID-19 Response. These deidentified data include demographic characteristics, exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, clinical data, laboratory diagnostic test results, and comorbidities. All data elements can be found on the COVID-19 case report form located at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/pui-form.pdf. The Case Surveillance Task Force and Surveillance Review and Response Group (SRRG) within CDC’s COVID-19 Response provide stewardship for datasets that support the public health community’s access to COVID-19 data while protecting patient privacy. COVID-19 case reports have been routinely submitted using standardized case reporting forms. On April 5, 2020, CSTE released an Interim Position Statement with national surveillance case definitions for COVID-19 included. Current versions of these case definitions are available here: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/. All cases reported on or after were requested to be reported by public health departments to CDC using the standardized case definitions for lab-confirmed or probable cases. On May 5, 2020, the standardized case reporting form was revised. Implementation of case reporting using this new form is ongoing among U.S. states and territories. The COVID-19 case surveillance data are dynamic; case reports can be modified at any time by the reporting jurisdiction as new information becomes available (i.e., data are subject to change). Furthermore, reporting jurisdictions may report cases late. Version updates to the detailed and limited datasets will be available for request once a month. The datasets will include all cases with an initial report date of case to CDC at least 30 days prior to the creation of the previously updated datasets. This month lag will allow case reporting to be stabilized and ensure that time-dependent outcome data, including death, are accurately captured. CDC’s Case Surveillance Task Force routinely performs data quality assurance procedures (i.e., ongoing corrections and logic checks to address data errors). To date, the following data cleaning steps have been implemented: Questions that have been left unanswered (blank) on the case report form are re-classified to an Unknown value, if applicable to the question. For example, in the question “Was the patient hospitalized?”, where the possible answer choices include “Yes”, “No”, or “Unknown”, the missing value is re-coded to the Unknown answer option if the respondent did not answer the question. Logic checks are performed for date data. If an illogical date has been provided, CDC reviews the data with the reporting jurisdiction. For example, if a symptom onset date that is in the future is reported to CDC, this value is set to null until the reporting jurisdiction updates this information appropriately. The initial report date of the case to CDC is intended to be completed by the reporting jurisdiction when data are submitted. If blank, this variable is completed using the date the data file was first submitted to CDC. Additional data quality processing to recode free text data are ongoing.

In this release, counts of deaths are provided by the race and Hispanic origin of the decedent. Topics will be added to the release as they become available. These provisional counts are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. Data shown on this page may be incomplete and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Data on this page are revised weekly and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1–2 weeks. Weighted population distributions more accurately reflect race/ethnic distributions of the geographic locations where COVID outbreaks are occurring (see below for the methods used to calculate weighted percentages). The weighted population distributions ensure that the population estimates and percentages of COVID-19 deaths represent comparable geographic areas, in order to provide information about whether certain racial and ethnic subgroups are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 mortality. See Table 2 below for unweighted populations. Estimated distributions of COVID-19 deaths and population size by race and Hispanic origin The percentages of COVID-19 deaths by race and Hispanic origin were calculated by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths for each race and Hispanic origin group by the total number of COVID-19 deaths. Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding. The distribution of deaths involving COVID-19 by race/ethnicity should not be compared to the race/ethnicity distribution of the U.S. population because COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in certain geographic locations where the racial and ethnic population distribution differs from that of the United States overall. Additionally, COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in certain areas within states, and it is therefore not appropriate to compare the percent of COVID-19 deaths by race/ethnicity to the racial/ethnic population distribution of a given state. To make the estimated population distribution more comparable to the geographic areas where COVID-19 deaths are occurring, weighted population distributions are provided in this report. The weighted population distributions were calculated as follows. County-level population counts by race and Hispanic origin were multiplied by the corresponding total count of COVID-19 deaths by county (of residence). These weighted counts were then summed to the state (or national) level. The percentage of the population within each race and Hispanic origin group by state (or for the U.S.) was then estimated using these weighted counts. Counties with no COVID-19 deaths received a weight of zero, and thus do not contribute to the weighted population totals. Population counts for counties with large numbers of COVID-19 deaths are upweighted proportional to their numbers of COVID-19 deaths. These weighted population distributions ensure that the population estimates and percentages of COVID-19 deaths represent comparable geographic areas, in order to provide information about whether certain racial and ethnic subgroups are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 mortality. For example, assume that 75% of the total number of COVID deaths occurred in a single county, County X, while the other 25% of COVID deaths occurred in County Y, and all other counties reported zero deaths. The weighted population counts for County X would contribute 75% of the total population counts, while the population counts for Count Source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/provisional-death-counts-for-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-weekly-state-specific-data-updat-9c2c7 Last updated at https://catalog.data.gov/organization/hhs-gov : 2020-06-20 [More about U.S. Government Works](https://www.usa.gov/government-works) "},"v_5":{"type":"literal","value":"Public Domain"},"v_6":{"type":"literal","value":"coronavirus;deaths;ethnicity;mortality;nchs;population;race;state"},"v_8":{"type":"literal","datatype":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean","value":"true"}},{"v_0":{"type":"literal","value":"us-hhs-gov"},"v_1":{"type":"literal","value":"8b634eb1-fb4f-439d-99f0-bc392fac4f19"},"v_2":{"type":"literal","value":"Provisional COVID-19 Death Counts by Week Ending Date and..."},"v_3":{"type":"literal","value":"Provisional COVID-19 Death Counts by Week Ending Date and State"},"v_4":{"type":"literal","value":"*Original Title*: Provisional COVID-19 Death Counts by Week Ending Date and State Deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), pneumonia, and influenza reported to NCHS by week ending date and by state Source: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/provisional-covid-19-death-counts-by-week-ending-date-and-state Last updated at https://catalog.data.gov/organization/hhs-gov : 2020-06-20 [More about U.S. Government Works](https://www.usa.gov/government-works) "},"v_5":{"type":"literal","value":"Public Domain"},"v_6":{"type":"literal","value":"coronavirus;death;influenza;mortality;nchs;pneumonia;state;week"},"v_8":{"type":"literal","datatype":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#boolean","value":"true"}},{"v_0":{"type":"literal","value":"us-hhs-gov"},"v_1":{"type":"literal","value":"9a830c1b-9d5b-4ff0-9484-0375bfb531e0"},"v_2":{"type":"literal","value":"Conditions contributing to deaths involving coronavi... 2019"},"v_3":{"type":"literal","value":"Conditions contributing to deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), by age group, United States."},"v_4":{"type":"literal","value":"*Original Title*: Conditions contributing to deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), by age group, United States.

This file was assembled by HHS via CMS, HRSA and reviewed by leadership and compares the HHS Provider Relief Fund and the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments by State and provider as of May 15, 2020. HHS Provider Relief Fund President Trump is providing support to healthcare providers fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which provide a total of $175 billion for relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid. The Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans. HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future. As part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure. As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments. The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date. We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete. CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program On March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS’s Provider Relief Fund. Since expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers—including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers— during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments. The AAP program is not a grant, and providers and suppliers are required to repay the loan. Provider Relief Fund Data - https://data.cdc.gov/Administrative/Provider-Relief-Fund-COVID-19-High-I...

National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified that have been received and coded. It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1-2 weeks. The provisional data presented on this page include the weekly provisional count of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), and pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19; (a) by week ending date, (b) by age at death, and (c) by specific jurisdictions. Future updates to this release may include additional detail such as demographic characteristics (e.g., sex), additional causes of death (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome or other comorbidities), or estimates based on models that account for reporting delays to generate more accurate predicted provisional counts. Pneumonia deaths are included to provide context for understanding the completeness of COVID-19 mortality data and related trends. Deaths due to COVID-19 may be misclassified as pneumonia deaths in the absence of positive test results, and pneumonia may appear on death certificates as a comorbid condition. Thus, increases in pneumonia deaths may be an indicator of excess COVID-19-related mortality. Additionally, estimates of completeness for pneumonia deaths may provide context for understanding the lag in reporting for COVID-19 deaths, as it is anticipated that these causes would have similar delays in reporting, processing, and coding. However, it is possible that reporting of COVID-19 mortality may be slower or faster than for other causes of death, and that the delay may change over time. Analyses to better understand and quantify reporting delays for COVID-19 deaths and related causes are underway. The list of causes provided in these tables may expand in future releases as more data are received, and other potentially comorbid conditions are determined. Technical notes Comparing data in this report to other sources Provisional death counts in this report will not match counts in other sources, such as media reports or numbers from county health departments. Death data, once received and processed by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), are tabulated by the state or jurisdiction in which the death occurred. Death counts are not tabulated by the decedent’s state of residence. COVID-19 deaths may also be classified or defined differently in various reporting and surveillance systems. Death counts in this report include laboratory confirmed COVID-19 deaths and clinically confirmed COVID-19 deaths. This includes deaths where COVID-19 is listed as a “presumed” or “probable” cause. Some local and state health departments only report laboratory-confirmed COVID deaths. This may partly account for differences between NCHS reported death counts and death counts reported in other sources. Provisional counts reported here track approximately 1–2 weeks behind other published data sources on the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. (1,2,3).

This dataset is a companion to the COVID-19 Daily Cases and Deaths dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/naz8-j4nc). The major difference in this dataset is that the cases, deaths, and corresponding rates per 100,000 population are not those for the single date indicated. They are rolling averages for the seven-day period ending on that date. This rolling average is used to account for fluctuations that may occur in the data, such as fewer cases being reported on weekends, and small numbers. The intent is to give a more representative view of the ongoing COVID-19 experience, less affected by what is essentially noise in the data. All rates are per 100,000 population in the indicated group, or Chicago, as a whole, for “Total” columns. Only Chicago residents are included based on the home address as provided by the medical provider. Confirmed cases are counted on the date the test specimen was collected. Deaths are those occurring among confirmed cases based on the day of death. Demographic data are based on what is reported by medical providers and is not verified by CDPH. Denominators are from the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimate for 2018 and can be seen in the Citywide, 2018 row of the Chicago Population Counts dataset (https://data.cityofchicago.org/d/85cm-7uqa). All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received and it is, in fact, very common for recent dates to be incomplete and to be updated as time goes on. At any given time, this dataset reflects cases and deaths currently known to CDPH. Numbers in this dataset may differ from other public sources due to definitions of COVID-19-related cases and deaths, sources used, how cases and deaths are associated to a specific date, and similar factors.

This is the source data for some of the metrics available at https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/latest-data.html. For all datasets related to COVID-19, see https://data.cityofchicago.org/browse?limitTo=datasets&sortBy=alpha&tags=covid-19. Only Chicago residents are included based on the home ZIP Code as provided by the medical provider. If a ZIP was missing or was not valid, it is displayed as \"Unknown\". Confirmed cases are counted based on the week the test specimen was collected. For privacy reasons, until a ZIP Code reaches five cumulative cases, both the weekly and cumulative case counts will be blank. Therefore, summing the “Cases - Weekly” column is not a reliable way to determine case totals. Deaths are those that have occurred among confirmed cases based on the week of death. For tests, each individual is counted once, based on the week the test specimen was collected. Tests performed prior to 3/1/2020 are not included. Test counts do not include multiple tests for the same person or some negative tests not reported to CDPH. The “Percent Tested Positive” columns are calculated by dividing the corresponding Cases and Tests columns. Because of the data limitations for the Tests columns, as well as strict criteria for performing COVID-19 tests, these percentages may vary in either direction from the actual disease prevalence in the ZIP Code. Of particular note, these rates do not represent population-level disease surveillance. Population counts are from the 2010 Decennial Census. All data are provisional and subject to change. Information is updated as additional details are received. To compare ZIP Codes to Chicago Community Areas, please see http://data.cmap.illinois.gov/opendata/uploads/CKAN/NONCENSUS/ADMINISTRATIVE_POLITICAL_BOUNDARIES/CCAzip.pdf. Both ZIP Codes and Community Areas are also geographic datasets on this data portal.

The primary goal of publishing this dataset is to provide users timely information about local disease spread and reporting of positive cases. The data will be updated daily, reflecting tests completed by 12:00 am (midnight) the day of the update (i.e., all tests completed by the end of the day on the day before the update). Reporting of SARS-CoV2 laboratory testing results is mandated under Part 2 of the New York State Sanitary Code. Clinical laboratories, as defined in Public Health Law (PHL) § 571 electronically report test results to the New York State Department of Health (DOH) via the Electronic Clinical Laboratory Reporting System (ECLRS). The DOH Division of Epidemiology’s Bureau of Surveillance and Data System (BSDS) monitors the reporting and ensures that all positives and negatives are accurately. Test counts reflect those completed on an individual each day. A person may have multiple specimens tested on one day, these would be counted one time, i.e., if two specimens are collected from an individual at the same time and then evaluated, the outcome of the evaluation of those two samples to diagnose the individual is counted as a single test of one person, even though the specimens may be tested separately. Conversely, if an individual is tested on more than one day, the data will show two tests of an individual, one for each date the person was tested. Test counts are assigned to a county based on this order of preference: 1) the patient’s address, 2) the ordering healthcare provider’s address, or 3) the ordering facility’s address.

The California influenza surveillance system is a collaborative effort between CDPH and its many partners at local health departments, public health and clinical laboratories, vital statistics offices, healthcare providers, clinics, emergency departments, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). California data are also included in the CDC weekly influenza surveillance report, FluView, and help contribute to the national picture of Influenza activity in the United States. The information collected allows CDPH and CDC to: 1) find out when and where influenza activity is occurring; 2) track influenza-related illness; 3) determine what influenza viruses are circulating; 4) detect changes in influenza viruses; and 5) measure the impact influenza is having on hospitalizations and deaths.

In separate time periods starting in early February 2020, we have analyzed more than 19.95M tweets that mention Coronavirus and/or COVID-19 using the free Twitter public API. We used information entropy measures calculated from both the text content and the timing of the tweets to identify accounts displaying significantly more automation than normal Twitter users. To date, we have identified 3,378 such automated accounts. We then applied network graph analysis techniques to determine which automated accounts were most successful in getting their content shared or retweeted. Consistent with our prior research on automated Twitter accounts in the political realm, we find that cyborgs, actual humans who use special software to control or automate their posts, are generally much more successful than fully automated bots.

This new tool is available to the public now and takes into account the most recent coronavirus research and latest local data on COVID-19 cases. The new Qventus planning tool is based on a modified [SEIR model](https://www.idmod.org/docs/hiv/model-seir.html), and incorporates a live feed of local case count and resource availability estimates. The tool consists of 450 localized epidemiological models that are run and updated daily, providing an up-to-date perspective on the impact of the pandemic in local areas. This new tool provides broad range of controls and assumptions and provides specific epidemiological planning scenarios, allowing frontline teams to: * Predict new and cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations and level of care needs for individual hospitals, multiple hospitals, and regions * Identify critical capacity constraints for Med-Surg, ICU, ventilator, and PPE resources — e.g., days remaining until you reach capacity — by hospital * Evaluate the impact of social distancing, PPE conservation, infection of hospital staff, improved length of stay, and other scenarios * Make decisions based on the most up-to-date data and research related to COVID-19, localized for your health system and market ### **Methodology Highlight** The key to this model is combining the most current coronavirus research with the most recent COVID-19 case data available on a local basis. Highlights of the model and methodology include: * **Localization:** The number of known cases, doubling time (computed from case counts), population demographics, estimated percent of infections reported, expected incubation times, and expected recovery times are used to fit this model to a specific area. * **Market level aggregation:** The model uses HRRs (Dartmouth Atlas Project [Hospital Referral Regions](https://www.dartmouthatlas.org/faq/)) instead of counties, zips, or other methods to better align with care-seeking patterns of patients for the geography being modeled. * **Research and Data Driven Assumptions:** Wherever possible and appropriate, the model automatically calculates default parameters according to the specific hospital(s) selected. Some parameters are assumed not to vary by region (e.g., incubation period), while others use a single default but remain editable by the user based on any better information they have available (e.g., percent of infections being reported).

We're seeing more frequent scrums to understand digital performance at a time when customer behaviors, needs and attitudes are rapidly changing. We're seeing a shift in market positioning and an increase in the need to test that messaging. We're seeing COVID-19 message tracking operationalized, so everyone in the organization can gain a better handle on what exactly is happening.

NOTE: There are several limitations to this is preliminary data. - The first deadline for reporting data was 11:59 p.m. Sunday, May 17, 2020. As the number of facilities reporting increases each week, it will increase the reported number of COVID-19 cases, suspected cases, and deaths each week. - As with any new reporting program, some facilities will struggle with their first submissions, and therefore, some of the data from their early submissions may be inaccurate. Since facilities may correct data in future weeks, the data is subject to fluctuations as data for previously reported weeks may change when the website is updated. - The availability of testing may impact the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases facilities report. For example, facilities that did not have the ability to test all residents a few weeks ago would not be able to report all residents with confirmed cases. Similarly, access to testing can vary by state, region, or facility. - Facilities may opt to report cumulative data retrospectively back to January 1, 2020. Therefore, some facilities may be reporting higher numbers of cases/deaths compared to other facilities, due to their retrospective reporting. Numbers for Week Ending 05/24/2020 may include reporting for any time between 01/01/2020 through 05/24/2020. Reporting for subsequent weeks is on a weekly basis. - Data Quality Assurance (QA) and Validation (QA Flags): Data quality checks were performed to identify instances where facilities may have entered incorrect data, such as entering cumulative counts over time instead of new cases, and other data entry errors. In these cases, we will display facilities as having submitted data, but will not include their data in our dataset or analyses to preserve the accuracy of the data presented. Facilities that have submitted erroneous data will have an “N” displayed in the column titled “Passed Quality Assurance Check.” For more detailed information about this process, please reference the CMS/CDC Nursing Home COVID-19 Data Quality Assurance Process. Due to these factors, CMS cautions users to consider these factors when performing any analysis. For example, data reported over the first few weeks should not be used to perform trend analysis and longitudinal analyses.

In these cases, we will display facilities as having submitted data, but will not include their data in our dataset or analyses to preserve the accuracy of the data presented. Facilities that have submitted erroneous data will have an “N” displayed in the column titled “Passed Quality Assurance Check.” For more detailed information about this process, please reference the CMS/CDC Nursing Home COVID-19 Data Quality Assurance Process. Due to these factors, CMS cautions users to consider these factors when performing any analysis. For example, data reported over the first few weeks should not be used to perform trend analysis and longitudinal analyses.

The following data show the number of COVID-19 cases and associated deaths per 100,000 population by race and ethnicity. Crude rates represent the total cases or deaths per 100,000 people. Age-adjusted rates consider the age of the person at diagnosis or death when estimating the rate and use a standardized population to provide a fair comparison between population groups with different age distributions. Age-adjustment is important in Connecticut as the median age of among the non-Hispanic white population is 47 years, whereas it is 34 years among non-Hispanic blacks, and 29 years among Hispanics. Because most non-Hispanic white residents who died were over 75 years of age, the age-adjusted rates are lower than the unadjusted rates. In contrast, Hispanic residents who died tend to be younger than 75 years of age which results in higher age-adjusted rates. The age-adjusted rates are directly standardized using the 2018 ASRH Connecticut population estimate denominators (available here: https://portal.ct.gov/DPH/Health-Information-Systems--Reporting/Population/Annual-State--County-Population-with-Demographics). Rates are standardized to the 2000 US Millions Standard population (data available here: https://seer.cancer.gov/stdpopulations/). Standardization was done using 19 age groups (0, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, ..., 80-84, 85 years and older). More information about direct standardization for age adjustment is available here: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt06rv.pdf Categories are mutually exclusive. The category “multiracial” includes people who answered ‘yes’ to more than one race category. Counts may not add up to total case counts as data on race and ethnicity may be missing. Age adjusted rates calculated only for groups with more than 20 deaths. Abbreviation: NH=Non-Hispanic. This dataset will be updated on a daily basis.

Methods: 1) Laboratory-confirmed case counts are based upon data reported via the FLIS web portal. Nursing homes were asked to provide cumulative totals of residents with laboratory confirmed covid. This includes residents currently in-house, in the hospital, or who are deceased. Residents were excluded if they tested positive prior to initial admission to the nursing home. 2) The cumulative number of deaths among nursing home residents is based upon data reported by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. For public health surveillance, COVID-19-associated deaths include persons who tested positive for COVID-19 around the time of death (laboratory-confirmed) and persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 disease as a cause of death or a significant condition contributing to death (probable). Limitations: 1) As of the week of 5/10/20, Point Prevalence Survey testing is being offered to all asymptomatic nursing home residents to inform infection prevention efforts. Point prevalence surveys will be conducted over a period of several weeks. Some nursing homes had adequate testing resources available to conduct surveys prior to this date. Differences in survey timing will impact the number of positive results that a nursing home reports. 2) Cumulative totals of residents testing positive are being collected rather than individual resident data. Thus we cannot verify the counts, de-duplicate, and/or verify whether there is a record of a positive lab test.

Currently the project is simply beginning and perhaps the data doesn't yet qualify as \"big\", but it could definitely be expanded if there was synergy within the Data Science community. I have made available an .RDS file containing an example of the data set. Essentially it is a combination of data made public by the NHS (National Health Service) enriched with third-party data from the Office for National Statistics and Google. More data from Google and an increase in specificty of geographical definitions could turn this data set potentially into a descriptor or perhaps a predictor of risk of infection by area. Modelling the data correctly could perhaps identify types of businesses in areas where the access to health services is greater or smaller and recommend the local community more granular precuations. This could potentially be a step towards a more flexible lockdown model, eased and tightened whenever needed. Further, this methodology could be turned into simply an alerting service for local businesses and individuals of statistcally significant changes in COVID-19-related use of helath services in local areas. This could be portrayed as a form of \"feeling the pulse\" of the COVID-19 state of things in a more granular way. This data set takes the data made public by the National Health Service of the United Kingdom (https://digital.nhs.uk/coronavirus), specificaly the reports of patients getting in touch via telephone or web for COVID-19 triage. This dataset contains general information on patients and the number of triage interactions they had with the clinical service. The data set has been enriched with data from the Office for National Statistics (https://www.ons.gov.uk/) through the David Kane's api on https://www.findthatpostcode.co.uk/ Socioeconomic tags have been appended to the CCG from which the patient has gotten in touch with Health Services. The data has been further enriched with data from Google Maps via Google's Places api. Currently, for each geographical area (given by the NHS CCG code) there are only twenty odd businesses which match the centres of the CCG geographical coordinates. Plenty more data could be retrieved from Google, which could potentially serve as a much better characterisation of the areas as well as the kind social gathering which such businesses foster. The data is in the form of a nested tibble.

[mmsa-icu-beds.csv](https://data.world/fivethirtyeight/covid-19-high-risk-individuals-per-icu-bed/workspace/file?filename=mmsa-icu-beds.csv) combines data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/smart/smart_2017.html), a collection of health-related surveys conducted each year of more than 400,000 Americans, and the [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://khn.org/news/as-coronavirus-spreads-widely-millions-of-older-americans-live-in-counties-with-no-icu-beds/#lookup) to show the number of people who are at high risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 per ICU bed in each metropolitan area, micropolitan area or metropolitan division for which we have data. Being high risk is defined by a number of health conditions and behaviors. Based on the CDC’s [list of the relevant underlying conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-at-higher-risk.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fspecific-groups%2Fpeople-at-higher-risk.html) that put people at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19, plus the advice of experts from the Cleveland Clinic, the American Lung Association and the American Heart Association, we counted people as at risk if they’re 65 or older; if they have ever been told they have hypertension, coronary heart disease, a myocardial infarction, angina, a stroke, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, chronic bronchitis or diabetes; if they currently have asthma or a BMI over 40; if they smoke cigarettes every day or some days or use e-cigarettes or vaping products every day or some days; or if they’re currently pregnant. We included every individual who meets at least one of these conditions but counted them only once each, so anyone with multiple conditions doesn’t get counted multiple times. We were not able to include a number of conditions for which we did not have location-based data from the BRFSS, such as liver disease, having smoked, vaped or dabbed marijuana in the last 30 days, and getting cancer treatment or being on immunosuppression medications.

In cases where the pollster did not provide sample sizes by party, they were calculated based on the percentage of total respondents who identified with each party. If the same poll asked more than one relevant question (using different wording), we included both questions, but the results of those questions were averaged together, then input into the model, so the poll was not double counted.

Death counts greater than 0 and less than 10 are dropped - these will be null (blank) values 3. Cases and deaths dropped altogether for areas where acs_population < 1000 Rate suppression in effect where counts lower than 20 Rates are not calculated unless the case count is greater than or equal to 20. Rates are generally unstable at small numbers, so we avoid calculating them directly. We advise you to apply the same approach as this is best practice in epidemiology. A note on Census ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) ZIP Code Tabulation Areas are special boundaries created by the U.S. Census based on ZIP Codes developed by the USPS. They are not, however, the same thing. ZCTAs are areal representations of routes. Read how the Census develops ZCTAs on their website. Row included for Citywide case counts, incidence rate, and deaths A single row is included that has the Citywide case counts and incidence rate. This can be used for comparisons. Citywide will capture all cases regardless of address quality. While some cases cannot be mapped to sub-areas like Census Tracts, ongoing data quality efforts result in improved mapping on a rolling bases.

These multiple streams of data are merged, deduplicated, undergo quality assurance and other data verification processes, and are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with COVID-19. C. UPDATE PROCESS Updated daily, dataset uploaded manually by staff D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET Case counts are provided by category of the disposition. Confirmed are those cases where lab testing was positive, deaths are those cases of infection resulting in death. To get counts in either category, you must filter the Case Type Disposition or pivot the data. Transmission Category can be Community, Contact or Unknown. Unknowns may become known as more information becomes available about cases. There are two other datasets related to cases: 1. COVID-19 Cases Summarized by Age Group and Gender 2.

We define our day as midnight-to-midnight, Pacific time. Cities represent usage in greater metropolitan areas and are stably defined during this period. In many countries/regions and cities, relative volume has increased since January 13th, consistent with normal, seasonal usage of Apple Maps. Day of week effects are important to normalize as you use this data. Data that is sent from users’ devices to the Maps service is associated with random, rotating identifiers so Apple doesn’t have a profile of your movements and searches. Apple Maps has no demographic information about our users, so we can’t make any statements about the representativeness of our usage against the overall population. **_Source:_** https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility **By downloading or using this data, you agree to Apple's terms.** # Terms of Use These Terms of Use, as well as any and all terms associated with www.apple.com, apply to the Apple Mobility Trends Reports website located at https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility (the “Site”) (collectively, the “Terms of Use”).

The only information I could find was this new page called **[Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm)** on the CDC website. The site reports **37,308** total deaths in their count as of May 1: @(https://data.world/andykatz/investigating-death-counts/workspace/file?filename=cdc%20new%20provisional%20count.png) This does seem to contradict the number displayed on the CDC homepage: @(https://data.world/andykatz/investigating-death-counts/workspace/file?filename=cdc%20total%20count.png) ​ The site says that it is up to date as of May 1st, but it only includes data up to April 25. So in order to compare that to other counts we would have to look at the count at that time. I took the [dataset from the AP ](https://data.world/associatedpress/covid-tracking-project-testing-in-states)to stand in for the existing death count to do a comparison. I sliced it up into a count of deaths per day: @(https://data.world/andykatz/investigating-death-counts/workspace/file?filename=Deaths%20Per%20Day) And then I summed up the number of deaths up until April 25: @(https://data.world/andykatz/investigating-death-counts/workspace/file?filename=Total%20deaths%20as%20of%202020-04-25) Compared with the CDC count of **37,308** that does show a **22% decrease** in the number of deaths counted. But if you look again at the CDC table you see that the \"percent of expected deaths\" for April 25 is well below 100% which is a stark contrast from the previous dates. Below the table is this note: > \\*Data during this period are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes.

Data is updated on a daily basis. Notes: * All figures (excluding variables with names containing \"MOH report\") are as at press release within the day and are **not back-dated** to update any changes that the Ministry of Health (MOH) might have made. More specifically, number of daily confirmed, discharged (and to isolation), imported, death and intensive care unit counts are extracted and the cumulative figures are computed based on these (as follows). It is important to note that there are inconsistencies with the cumulative discharged reported beginning 11 Apr in the press release where the previous day figure and daily count doesn't add up to the cumulative discharged and hence these cumulative figures are not extracted from the press release. * Figures on the total number who are in general wards (\"General Wards MOH report\"), in isolation (\"In Isolation MOH report\"), completed isolation (\" Total Completed Isolation MOH report \") and total discharged from hospitals (\"Total Hospital Discharged MOH report \") beginning 20 Mar were made available in MOH situtation reports and included in the dataset from then. * Figures on the number of local cases residing in dormitories (\"Local cases residing in dorms MOH report\") and local cases not residing in dormitories (\"Local cases residing in dorms MOH report\") are made available in MOH situation reports beginning 29 Mar and included in the dataset from then. It is important to note that adding these two numbers up might not tally with \"Daily Local transmission\" because the figures in the situation reports are as at a later date whereas the \"Daily Local transmission\" figure is based as at time of press release on the actual day itself. Hence ongoing investigations made could result in a change in imported/ local transmission status and is reflected in the situation reports. * On 11 May 2020, 35 cases of false positives were identified and removed from the count of total confirmed cases. * \"Daily imported\" and \"Daily Local transmission\" make up \"Daily Confirmed\". * \"Daily Discharged\" summed across days contribute to \"Cumulative Discharged\". * \"Passed but not due to COVID\" is recorded as an extra detail for cases that were considered as discharged instead of death. * \"Tested positive demise\" refers to cases that were found to have COVID-19 infection after demise. They have passed due to other reasons. * \"Still Hospitalised\" is computed based on \"Total Confirmed\" - \"Cumulative Discharged\" - \"Discharged to Isolation\" - \"Cumulative Deaths\" - \"Tested positive demise\" (summed). ​ ![https://media.data.world/ppFQLrRRQYKUdNyFBzlw\\_image.png](https://media.data.world/ppFQLrRRQYKUdNyFBzlw_image.png) ![https://media.data.world/jrtOWbVrSyBHI5AxG5MQ\\_image.png](https://media.data.world/jrtOWbVrSyBHI5AxG5MQ_image.png) Cumulative recovered/ discharged figures for certain days were subsequently changed. Eg. 22 Apr (see screenshot above and below). These changes are not updated into the dataset as cumulative figures in the dataset were derived based on daily discharged and as shown above, there were discrepancies between what's reported and the cumulative derived - there is no further elaboration on how the cumulative recovered/ discharged figures reported were computed. ![https://media.data.world/Q0ng7SOPQYGLY5kyQNAI\\_image.png](https://media.data.world/Q0ng7SOPQYGLY5kyQNAI_image.png) "},"v_6":{"type":"literal","value":"coronavirus;covid19;singapore;time series"}},{"v_0":{"type":"literal","value":"smartersorting"},"v_1":{"type":"literal","value":"covid-19-disinfectants"},"v_2":{"type":"literal","value":"COVID-19 Disinfectants"},"v_3":{"type":"literal","value":"A UPC-level list of EPA-approved disinfectants to help combat COVID-19.

We at Smarter Sorting took that list and bumped it up against our database of consumer chemical goods. By matching on EPA Registration Number, we've created a growing list of UPCs (aka Universal Product Codes aka barcodes) and Product Names to help make it easier for consumers to find these disinfectants. We have also included the EPA's instructions on how to best use these products. Make note of Contact Time, which the EPA defines as \"the amount of time the surface should be treated for. The surface should be visibly wet for the duration of the contact time.\" For more on this initiative, check out our recent blog post: https://www.smartersorting.com/2020/03/31/retailers-help-customers-stop-covid-19-with-this-data-set-of-epa-approved-disinfectants/ If you are a retailer, brand, city or data-person-at-large and want to help us grow this list and make it more usable, please reach out to Zach Hamstra (zach@smartersorting.com).
